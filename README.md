# mqtt_application
MQTT is an OASIS standard messaging protocol for the Internet of Things (IoT). It is designed as an extremely lightweight publish/subscribe messaging transport that is ideal for connecting remote devices with a small code footprint and minimal network bandwidth.

The application is built using python to connect to the broker 'inet-mqtt-broker.mpi-inf.mpg.de' with port '1883'. The required modules are random and time.
